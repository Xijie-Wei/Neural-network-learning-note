# Neural-network-learning-note

## Introduction
This is a note taken down when I was learning to set up and train a network with Pytorch.
This project is about getting familiar with Pytorch with the tutorial 'Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz' by Soumith Chintala from: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html And try to set up a hand-writing number classification neural network with dataset MNIST. This repository is a note and Ill try to explain my code as possible. However, parts like the neural network structure are what Im not familiar with (which I still need to spend time learning, Im just a beginner in this field), so I`ll just skip them.

## Code 
In this part, I`ll try to explain my code as much as possible.<br/>
The libs used in this project are `torch` and `torchvision`
